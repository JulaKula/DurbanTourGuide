    <string name="info_text">Durban (Zulu: eThekwini, from itheku meaning \"bay/lagoon\") is the largest
        city in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal and the third most populous in South Africa
        after Johannesburg and Cape Town. Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is famous
        for being the busiest port in the country. It is also seen as one of the major centres of tourism
        because of the city\'s warm subtropical climate and extensive beaches. Durban forms part of the
        eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, which includes neighboring towns and has a population of
        about 3.44 million. In May 2015, Durban was officially recognised as one of the New7Wonders Cities
        (together with Vigan, Doha, La Paz, Havana, Beirut, and Kuala Lumpur).
        \n\nRainbow nation is a term coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to describe post-apartheid South Africa,
        after South Africa\'s first fully democratic election in 1994. The term was intended to encapsulate
        the unity of multi-culturalism and the coming-together of people of many different nations,
        in a country once identified with the strict division of white and black.
        \n\nDurban is ethnically diverse, with a cultural richness of mixed beliefs and traditions.
        Zulus form the largest single ethnic group. It has a large number of people of British descent
        and has the most Indians of any city outside India. The influence of Indians in Durban has been
        significant, bringing with them a variety of cuisine, culture and religion. The faith-based
        conflict that is evident in many parts of the world is not reflected in Durban\'s religious landscape,
        where harmony is generally the order of the day.  While the legacy of apartheid is still with us
        in many ways, contemporary South Africa is a country of great tolerance and acceptance.</string>

    <string name="port_durban_info">Durban has a long tradition as a port city. The Port of Durban,
        formerly known as the Port of Natal, was an extremely busy port of call for ship repairs
        when the port was opened in the 1840s. Durban is now the busiest port in South Africa,
        as well as the fourth busiest container port in the Southern Hemisphere.</string>

    <string name="rickshaws_info">Durban is known for its iconic Zulu rickshaw pullers navigating throughout
        the city. These colourful characters are famous for their giant, vibrant hats and costumes.
        Although they have been a mode of transportation since the early 1900s, they have been displaced
        by other forms of motorised transport, and the 25 or so remaining rickshaws mostly cater to tourists.</string>
